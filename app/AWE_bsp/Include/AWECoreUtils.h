 @private
 * @brief Utility function for decoding a received encoded byte for byte-by-byte tuning interface.
 * Provide a pointer to the buffer that will be ultimately processed by awe_packetProcess. Internal state
 * variables will keep track of packet indexing, so always pass in start address of packet buffer.
 * The passed in encoded byte 'ch' will be internally decoded and pushed into the passed in packetBuffer.
 * Keep calling this function until INCOMPLETE_PACKET is not returned.
 *
 * Note: The byte-by-byte transmission protocol is designed to increase the robustness of transmitted
 * packets by inserting a start byte (0x02) and an end byte (0x03) to the packets. Doing this also requires
 * that the data in the packets be encoded to avoid the possibility of false start or end bytes within the payload.
 * This encoding, plus the addition of a sequence number in the packet to detect repeat transmissions,
 * means that the total size of the encoded packets will be [(decodedPacketSizeBytes * (5/4)) + 3] bytes long.
 * If the application will reserve space for an entire encoded packet to be available, it must be
 * [MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_WORDS * 5 + 3] bytes. For MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_WORDS = 264, this equals 1323 bytes.
